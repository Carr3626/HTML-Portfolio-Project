<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 39 year old Man, married with 4 wonderful children, I have 3 boys Ollie aged 13, Jaxon aged 10 and Roman aged 7 and I have my one and only duaghter Daisy who at the time of writing this is 9 weeks old. I am Married to the most beautiful woman Rebecca, we have been married for 12 years this year and together for almost 15 years. We also have 2 dogs A Pug called Peggy and a Frenchie called Honey and finally we have a tortoise called buddy. Needless to say our plates are very full and we have very little time to ourselves.</p>

<p>For work I am a stakeholder and Operations manager for a start up business dealing in the hydraulic Bolting and industrial tooling sectors, Myself along with 4 others are staring up to compete with our old employer who lost their way and sight of servicing the customer. We plan on bringing "customer First solutions" to the market, something which has been lost over time. My role see me doing all manner of tasks, I work in the workshop repairing tooling and equipment, Calibrating the serviced equipment and booking goods in and out. There is alot to do each day and managing the priorities is the most challenging part.</p>

<p>In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, going out and about on walks and taking the kids to places. I enjoy watching MMA and Boxing on a regular basis and practice Brazilian Jujitsu at which I am currently a white belt. I am at the time of writing this nursing a shoulder injury but plan on ghoing back soon as I love taking part in the sport. I Like to take the boys on fishing trips in when the better weather comes along too.</p>
